# Darts Manager

Welcome to my Darts Manager project. I made this application to make playing darts at home a little bit easier. Darts Manager is made in C# using WPF for GUI and entity framework for data manipulation. This application was made mainly for personal use, so don't expect high level of polish, but you are free to use it or build upon it if you wish. The application is very crude right now, but I would like to introduce some new functionality and document the code better in the future.

## What's planned

- [ ] Add screen with match details
- [ ] Add screen with player details
- [ ] Add screen with training details
- [ ] Add proper documentation to all classes

## Installation

1. Open the project in a C# IDE (such as Visual Studio)
2. Build the project
3. Run the application
